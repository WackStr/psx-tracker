# PSX Tracker

Building services to help track an index to guide your investment strategy.

While there are various schools of thoughts around trading, a very safe approach can be to track an index.

However, how do you track an index when you have limited funds that you are injecting at a given time and the mix of shares defining the index and their prices/market cap changes?

The services defined in this repository will help solve this challenge.

## Key capabilities to build
- tracking share prices and market capitablization - these are the tow main parameters when distrbuting a funds as per an index
- defining an index
- tracking a porfolio of a user (stocks purchased)
- defining how well is the index tracked
- tracking this closeness as prices, index composition, and market capitalization of companies changes
- given funds to invest, what purchasing (given that we can buy whole number shares) improves the index tracking
- if a user wants to sell shares to get a certain amount, what mix of shares will help achieve that amount while improving or minimally imapcting the index tracking
